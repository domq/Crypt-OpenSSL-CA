>>>>>>> Prepare version 0.20 in $VERSION and Changes file

0.18    12 Sep 2008
      - YACTBOR; don't try to use `openssl req` to create a PKCS#10, as this is
        known to fail on OpenSSL-installation-challenged cpan-testers systems.

        OpenSSL.

0.16    14 Feb 2008
      - YACTBOR.  Can now detect OpenSSL version before attempting the
        whole compile despite CPAN.pm's quirks.

0.15    13 Feb 2008
      - Added ->supported_digests(). Now the OpenSSL version is validated

        bugfixes.

0.14    08 Feb 2008
      - Fixes bug in the build process that caused it to fail
        on Perl 5.10; improved memory leak checking with
        Devel::Mallinfo.  No actual code changes.

0.12    06 Feb 2008
      - Improved readability of code examples (in examples/) as per
        the suggestions of Richard Hartmann
      - Tested on Mac OS X 10.5 with Macports Perl

        that also works on VMWare

0.09    05 Apr 2007
      - Tested on Gentoo
      - Added ::X509->verify

        shamelessy raise my Kwalitee
